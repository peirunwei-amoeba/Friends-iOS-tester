This is a pretty much useless first repository of mine, and stil, it is pretty much useless.
This, is a swift app that can access your photo library, and you can just add all the friends that you have, along with contact information and their picture, (which is basically exactly what whatsapp does)
Why would you need this? 
No, you won't, trust me.
But still, this is heavily adapted from a tutorial about saving pet information, but since I do not have any documentable pets, i just stuck with friends, and made a TON of additional features, coming to the main branch soon.
